@page page_tests Tests

Each library has at least an associated test in its `Tests` subfolder.  
The tests are structured to test functionality with 90%+ coverage and they look a lot like examples (they're not _unit_ tests).  
Check [Building (contributor)](@ref page_building_contributor) to build and run or step / debug the tests.
