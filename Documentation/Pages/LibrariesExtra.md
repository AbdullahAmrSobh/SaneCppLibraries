Some extra libraries are included in this repo even if they don't follow some of the rules.

Library                                             | Description
:---------------------------------------------------| :----------------------------
@subpage library_reflection_auto                    | @copybrief library_reflection_auto
@subpage library_serialization_binary_type_erased   | @copybrief library_serialization_binary_type_erased

@note [Reflection Auto](@ref library_reflection_auto) for example doesn't fully comply to some project principles, due to use complex C++ meta-programming techniques.  
[Serialization Type Erased](@ref library_serialization_binary_type_erased) is listed here as it's an alternative implementation.
