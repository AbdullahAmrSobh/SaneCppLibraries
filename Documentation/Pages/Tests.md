@page page_tests Tests

- Each library has at least an associated test in its `Tests` subfolder.  
- Many tests are written to serve also as examples and they are useful as reference code when learning how to use a given library.  
- Ideally tests should be targeting targeting 90%+ code coverage but we're not there yet.  
- Test coverage reports are built at every commit to master and published at [![Coverage](https://pagghiu.github.io/SaneCppLibraries/coverage/coverage.svg)](https://pagghiu.github.io/SaneCppLibraries/coverage)
- Check [Building (contributor)](@ref page_building_contributor) to build and run or step / debug the tests.
